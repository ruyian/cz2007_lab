### What is complaint?

#### Should complaint be an entity set or a relation between user and employee?

It should be an entity set. This is because complaint is a real-world object. 
In addition, there should be more than one relationship between user and complaint as the user can "file" a complaint, and can "check status" of the complaint

#### Should complaint be a weak entity set of employee

It shoud not. If a user complains about one product in a certain shop for several times, a weak entity is not able to represent it.

#### Different type of complaint

Since the complaint can be about the product or the shop, we need to classify the complaint into 2 subclasses, namely complaints about shop and complaints about product.

### What is price?

<mark> should be explained with a diagram </mark>

#### Is price an attribute or an entity set?

Price should be an entity set. If we use price as an attribute, there is no way we can trace the history of the price.
